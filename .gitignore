# This exclusion is convenient for anyone that wants to run phpMyAdmin from
# their local HTTP server while the Kickback Kingdom website is still
# available for testing. (Ex: you'd put your phpMyAdmin folder at
# `./html/phpmyadmin`, then have your browser navigate to `http://localhost/index.php`
# to access your development version of the Kickback Kingdom website, or
# have your browser navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php` to
# access phpMyAdmin, all without having to switch out what folder the
# HTTP server is hosting.)
